Pattern Recognition Using Regular Expressions:
Pattern 'dia' found at index 63

All occurrences of a pattern:
['n', 'n', 'n', 'n', 'n']

Matching the pattern at the start of the text:
Pattern matches

Replacing a pattern:
M S Ramaiah Institute of Technology is located in Bangalore, Bharat

Splitting the text based on a pattern:
['M S Ramaiah I', 'stitute of Tech', 'ology is located i', ' Ba', 'galore, I', 'dia']

Email validation:
Found

Pattern Recognition Without Using Regular Expressions:
Pattern 'dia' found at index 63
